                Finn Valle is a full-time Cybersecurity student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
                Before starting his educational journey with technology, Finn had quite the unusual habit
                of collecting unconventional pets. It started with hamsters in 2017, where a cute teddy bear hamster
                named Zacatecas stole the young man's heart. After building a palace from a 40 gallon fish tank, Finn
                decided it was time for more. He rescued another hamster named Louise and a small mouse named Klaus.
                Now being known as the small mammal rescuer, Finn found himself with another bundle of hamsters,
                three winter white dwarf hamsters named Marnie, Myrtle, and Yeralt. And yes, the madness did not stop
                stop there. Out of pure insanity, Finn also found two guinea pigs, Aksel and Annie. This wasn't
                helping the "unconventional pet" rumors. After a few years of taking care of small creatures,
                it was time for Finn to begin school. With no time to take care of the pets, Finn stopped rescuing
                pets that needed a lot of attention. So just before the pandemic, he turned to reptiles.
